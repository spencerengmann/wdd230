        <h3>Apple</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/"> Apple.com</a></p>

          Apple's website has a clean and well-aligned design. Many elements on
          the website are centered, both horizontally and vertically. The
          centered alignment can create a balanced and symmetrical look, which
          is pleasing to the eye and makes it easy to see what the company wants
          you to see.

          I love the website because when you visit the website you will notice
          related contents are placed together on the page. The menu items are
          in close proximity to each other making it easier to find particular
          sections of the website. This makes it easier for me to find the
          information I need.

          I like this website because it uses colors that are easier to see. It
          does not make it hard to see content. The page uses a red color and
          uses white-colored text on a red background. The main content text is
          black text on a white background. Makes everything easier to read and
          see.
